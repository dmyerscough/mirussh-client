SSH Client
==========

This utility generates a SSH certificate in-memory and sends the public key to a RESTful endpoint for signing.
The expected response from the RESTful endpoint is a signed SSH certificate and a certificate TTL.

This utility was used for setting up and managing signed SSH certificates.
